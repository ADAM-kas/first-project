# Quick Network Troubleshooting

Common steps I follow when internet stops working:

1. Check physical connections (cables, Wi-Fi switch).
2. Run `ipconfig /release` and `ipconfig /renew` in Command Prompt.
3. Restart router and modem.
4. Check Windows Network Diagnostics.
5. Ping 8.8.8.8 to test connectivity.
